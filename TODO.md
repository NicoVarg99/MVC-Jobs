# TODO

Mirco:
 - <strike>Create main menu as described in src/controller/controller.cpp
 - Create error printing function as described in src/controller/controller.cpp
 - Create debug printing function (eg. view_printDebug()) (see example in src/model/model.cpp). Make sure it prints only "if(DEBUG)"</strike>
 - <strike>All functions which are member of View must start with "view_"</strike>
 - <strike>Divide the file view.cpp into view.h and view.cpp</strike>
 - Function "bool view_printStudentsList(struct Student * students) that prints the list of all the students and their jobs"
 - Function "struct Student view_loadStudent()" that asks the user to insert the values (the number of the jobs and the jobs values too), you can fine a primitive version of it in "src/model/temp.cpp":62-80.
 - <strike>Function "void view_printWaitMessage()" that for now is just printf("Press [ENTER] to continue...");</strike>
 - ROLL BACK IMMEDIATELY TO PROCEDURAL PROGRAMMING


Carlo:
 - <strike>Read data file and print the list of the students using view_xxx as asked in src/controller/controller.cpp</strike>
 - <strike>Write the array of Struct Students to the file data/database.bin</strike>
